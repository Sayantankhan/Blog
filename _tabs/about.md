## 👋 Hello, I’m Sayantan Khan!

I’m a passionate **Software Engineer** and technology enthusiast with a focus on **full-stack development**, distributed systems, HPC, cloud-native systems, and open-source.

### 🔭 What I’m Working On
- Exploring cutting‑edge **container orchestration**, **distributed systems**, and **microservices**.
- Building hands‑on projects with **Docker**, **GraphQL**, **GCP**, **AWS**, **Node.js**, **Java**, **React**, and **MongoDB**.
- Developing integrations and tools across **DevOps** and **backend systems**.
- Diving into **High‑Performance Computing (HPC)** architectures and **RDMA networking**—especially **InfiniBand** and **RoCE**, which power over 73% of the world’s top supercomputers[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

### 🤝 I’m Looking to Collaborate On
- Open‑source software related to **cloud computing**, **platform engineering**, and **API development**.
- Projects integrating **microservices architectures** and **event‑driven systems**.
- Tools that make developers’ lives easier—**developer experience improvements**, **CLI tools**, or **automation scripts**.
- **HPC‑focused applications**, **RDMA‑optimized workloads**, and networking stacks utilizing **InfiniBand** or **RoCE** for low‑latency, high‑bandwidth compute clusters :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
